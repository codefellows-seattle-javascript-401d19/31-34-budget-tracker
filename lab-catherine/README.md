## Lab 31-34: Budget Tracker

![Budget Tracker Overview](./asset/budget-tracker-overview.png)

### Author:

### Motivation

In this project, I built a frontend Budget Tracker application. To create a new budget item, users can enter a name and a budget amount and click `create category`. Users can update a budget item by editing the information on the right-hand side of the corresponding budget item and clicking `update category`. Users also have the ability to remove any of their created budget items by clicking the `delete` button next to the budget item they would like to remove. 

Users can also add expenses to each category by entering an expense `name` and `price` and clicking the `create expense` button. Users can edit information and click `update expense` to update, and `delete` to remove the expense from the category.

In this application, I configured webpack to compile JavaScript and SASS into a bundle and configured babel to transpile JSX and ES6 to ES5 JavaScript. I was able to create and render React components to the DOM, add event listeners to React components, and update React component state.
