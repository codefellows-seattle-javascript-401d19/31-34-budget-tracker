## Purpose

Learn to use React with Redux by creating an API which allows a user to create an expense category with a name and budget. All the items are displayed in a list. Each item has a button that allows the user to delete it and a button that allows the user to edit the item. 

## To use

Install dependencies:
`npm install`
Run webpack dev server:
`npm run watch`
Open your browser at localhost:8080.

Type a name for your category into the name box. Enter a budget for your item into the $0.00 box. Click Create Category.

The item will be added to a list below the entry form. Click the delete button to delete a To Do item.
