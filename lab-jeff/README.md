# Codefellows javascript 401 lab 28-29 - REACT Routing/ Components/ Modal - ToDo list

## Purpose

Learn to use react, webpack, and related technologies by creating an API which allows a user to create a To Do list with a title and content. All the items are displayed in a list. Each item has a button that allows the user to delete it and a button that allows the user to edit the item. (Doubleclicking the item also invokes edit.) Edit brings up a modal window that allows the user to edit and save the item.

## To use

Install dependencies:
`npm install`
Run webpack dev server:
`npm run watch`
Open your browser at localhost:8080.

Type a title for your ToDo item into the Title box. Enter a description of your item into the Content Box. Click submit.

The item will be added to a list below the entry form. Click the delete button to delete a To Do item.
